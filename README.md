# Minimal-Portfolio-Website

My personal portfolio website
---
I made this to update my current personal portfolio as I wanted a more modern, responsive and clean portfolio website. I felt like that my previous portfolio website had too much 
going on for it as I tried to make it as complex and eye-catching as possible. However, I realized that it needed to be more clear and concise for potential employers to see so, I 
decided to remake my portfolio website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
